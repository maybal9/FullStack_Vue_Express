# Simple_Weather_API
A simple web application that groups together all my interview home-assignments.
Main goal is to practice web development skills and frameworks. 
Server side uses NodeJS + Express.
Client side uses Vue + Bulma.

# TODO:
* Server:
  * MongoDB integration
* General:
  * Consider deploying to Netlify

This app was built thanks to this step-by-step awesome guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j55fHUJqtyw&list=PLillGF-RfqbYSx-Ab1xWVanGKtowTsnNm
